### KMeans Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering** is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

- **Unsupervised Machine Learning** is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabeled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision. Without any previous data training, the machineâ€™s job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations. 

- **K-means clustering**, assigns data points to one of the K clusters depending on their distance from the center of the clusters. It starts by randomly assigning the clusters centroid in the space. Then each data point assign to one of the cluster based on its distance from centroid of the cluster. After assigning each point to one of the cluster, new cluster centroids are assigned. This process runs iteratively until it finds good cluster.
